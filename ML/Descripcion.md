# Clasificación Multietiqueta de Clientes según sus Compras

# Description 
- Customer segmentation involves dividing your customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics or behaviors.
- These segments help tailor marketing strategies, product recommendations, and customer experiences.
# Multi-Label Classification for Segmentation:
- Multi-label classifiers can be useful for assigning multiple labels (segments) to each customer.
- For example, you might have labels like “High Spenders,” “Frequent Shoppers,” “Loyal Customers,” and “Churn Risk.”
- By predicting these labels, you can create personalized marketing campaigns or targeted interventions.
# Benefits:
- Granularity: Multi-label segmentation allows for fine-grained categorization.
- Overlap: Customers can belong to multiple segments simultaneously (e.g., a high spender who is also a loyal customer).
- Dynamic: As customer behavior changes, the labels can adapt.
# Implementation Steps:
- Data Collection: Gather relevant customer data (purchase history, demographics, etc.).
- Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features (e.g., total spending, frequency of visits).
- Model Training: Train a multi-label classifier (e.g., using neural networks or ensemble methods). 
- Prediction: Assign labels to each customer based on model predictions.
# Considerations:
- Data Quality: Ensure clean, comprehensive data.
- Evaluation Metrics: Use appropriate metrics (e.g., F1-score, Hamming loss) for multi-label classification.
- Balancing Labels: Some segments may be underrepresented; consider techniques like oversampling or weighted loss.
# Example:
- Imagine a retail business:
- Customer A: High spender, frequent shopper
- Customer B: Loyal, infrequent shopper
- Customer C: Churn risk, occasional spender
- The multi-label classifier would predict these labels for each customer.
